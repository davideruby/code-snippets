## Config
- git config --add [--global] user.name rubi
- git config --get user.name  # --get is optional
- git config --unset user.name
- git config --list [--local]
- git config --unset-all user.name 
- git config --remove-section <section>

## Branching
- git branch
- git branch my-new-branch
- git switch -c my-new-branch  # or, the old way: git checkout -m my-new-branch

## Merge
- git merge feature  # merge feature into current-branch
- git log --oneline --decorate --parents
- git merge --abort

## Rebase
  # Set the initial commit of the current branch on the latest commit of main.
  # For example, if branch b has commits b1, b2 and b3, "git rebase main" will do:
  # main -> b1 -> b2 -> b3 
- git rebase main  

## Reset
- git reset --soft HEAD~1  # undo the last commit while keeping the changes (staged but not committed)
  # this will reset your working directory and index to the state of that commit, and all the changes made after that commit are lost forever. Be super careful with this.
- git reset --hard a1b2c3 

## Remote
  # In git, another repo is called a "remote". The standard convention is that when you are treating the remote 
  # as "the authoritative source of truth" (such as Github) you would name it the "origin".
  # By the way, in git, a remote is just another repo, and it can be even a local repo. Sometimes people think remote are only
  # available on Github, but it is not true.
- git remote add origin ../another-local-repo
- git fetch  # this downloads copies of all the contents of the .git/objects directory from the remote repository into your current one.
- git log origin/branch  # show commits of the remote branch 
- git merge origin/main

## Squash
- git rebase -i HEAD~n  # n is the number of commits to be squashed.

## Stash
- git stash
- git stash -m "almost working"
- git stash list
- git stash pop  # apply your most recent stash.
- git stash apply stash@{2}  # apply the third (0, 1, 2) most recent stash.
- git stash drop stash@{2}  # drop the third most recent stash.

## Revert
- git revert <commit-hash>  # it creates a commit doing the exact opposite of <commit-hash>

## Diff
- git diff 
- git diff HEAD~1
- git diff <commit-hash1> <commit-hash2>

## Cherry Pick
  # Use this when you want a specific commit from a branch and not the entire branch
- git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

## Bisect
- git bisect start
- git bisect good
- git bisect bad
- git bisect reset
- git bisect run ./scripts/bisect.sh  # bisect.sh returns 1 for bad and 0 for good

## Tags
- git tag -a "major.minor.patch" -m "tag message"  # semantic versioning (semver)
